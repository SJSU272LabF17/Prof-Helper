Prof Helper!

This project is designed to interpret handwriting in an image and give a online readable text.

We have used Microsoft Cognitive Computer Vision API.

The text is analyzed and stored in a spreadsheet, along with the marks and comments of the professor for the analyzed text.

The gs script(script.gs) for directly storing the data into spreadsheet is written and can be used for anyone with few changes as mentioned in the script itself.

There are around 50 images in Testing Image folder for reference, as to what are the different types of images we have tested our web application.

The project is coded using jquery and node.js.

To run the project:

Go to AnalyzeText2 Folder.

Give commands on terminal:

npm install

npm start

The project should be up and running

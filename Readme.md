## Project Name: Prof. Helper

## Problem Statement
Many students lose important marks in examinations even after writing the correct answers due to ambiguous/bad handwriting. Prof helper converts the hand-written text into standard text on the computer screen which helps the professor to read the exact answers of the students and grade them accordingly.

## Solution
So to avoid above situation we have come up with the solution which is our web application i.e. Prof Helper, which allows the professor to upload photos of the writing piece of every student and the converted computerized text can be seen on the same page. After judging the text, the professor is allowed to grade the studentâ€™s work, comment on it and email the grades and comments to the student. The teacher can also save the marks, comments and name/email of the student in a spreadsheet which can be used later.

This application is developed using ejs and jquery as frontend and Node JS as backend.

We have used Microsoft Cognitive Computer Vision API.

The gs script(script.gs) for directly storing the data into spreadsheet is written and can be used for anyone with few changes as mentioned in the script itself.

We have 50 different types of images in Testing Image folder for reference, as to what are the different images our web application can interpret.
